Consider four processes with the following starting and ending times:

| Process | Start time | End time |
| ------- | ---------- | -------- |
| A       | 5          | 7        |
| B       | 2          | 4        |
| C       | 3          | 6        |
| D       | 1          | 8        |

For each pair of processes, indicate whether they run concurrently (Y) or not (N):

## Answer

| Process pair | Concurrent? |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| AB           | N           |
| AC           | Y           |
| AD           | Y           |
| BC           | Y           |
| BD           | Y           |
| CD           | Y           |
